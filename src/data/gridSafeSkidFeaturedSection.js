    title: "A Revolution in Utility Grid Protection and Monitoring Worldwide",
    text: "Utilities often use traditional hand-held infrared camera technology, which is labor-intensive and provides only limited, momentary data that requires human manipulation and interpretation. Fixed-in-place optical security cameras require constant human monitoring. Otherwise, they simply collect a historic record of events to be viewed post-incident. <br/><br/> We have a better idea. Sytis has developed a game-changing product called GridSafe™. GridSafe™ combines bi-spectral (infrared/optical) PTZ cameras with our user-friendly InfraSpec™ software. This patent-pending software uses machine learning to track and notify utility personnel in real-time with both warnings and alerts related to physical threats (fire, eco-terrorism, trespassing, etc.) and/or component issues. And we do it while staying out of your network!​ ",

    title: "Comprehensive Substation Monitoring",
    text: "Utility asset issues can escalate quickly. Traditional inspection programs often fail to provide actionable data or only collect information after problems arise. Scheduled inspections can mean missing opportunities for predictive maintenance, as issues usually arise under their own schedule. GridSafe™ enables users to monitor thousands of components with one camera and monitor beyond the fence-line at the same time using 'presets'. Seeing issues in their earliest stages allows for planning and ensures timely responses while preventing catastrophic failures or intrusions. <br/><br/> The system is built on a heavy galvanized steel skid, which is classified as a fixed asset but is still portable within substations for easy repositioning. It features a telescoping mast for high vantage points, and its network cabinet houses the NVR (Network Video Recorder), cellular router, backup power, and access to InfraSpec™ Software for seamless web-based monitoring.!​ ",
